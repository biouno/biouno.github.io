<p>
	There are different ways to install plug-ins. BioUno has some Jenkins
	plug-ins that have to be installed manually. You can find the complete
	documentation for installing plug-ins in the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins#Plugins-Howtoinstallplugins" title="Plug-ins Wiki
	page">Plug-ins Wiki page</a> from Jenkins project.
</p>

<p>
	From the main screen, go to <em>Manage Jenkins</em> and in sequence to
	<em>Manage Plugins</em>.
</p>

	</a>
</p>

<p>
	There you should see a screen with four tabs. Looks for the <em>Available</em>
	tab. Clicking on it will bring the list of available plug-ins,
	organized by categories.

</p>

<p>
	As we've talked about notifications prior, look for the <em>email-ext
		plugin</em>. This plug-ins adds more options for sending
	notifications from your builds.
</p>

<p>
	In newer versions of Jenkins you can install some plug-ins without
	having to restart. All you have to do is just click on <em>Install
		without restart</em>.

</p>

<p>Wait until the screen is refreshed and voil√†, you have just
	installed your first plug-in.</p>
