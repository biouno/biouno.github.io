Notifications usually occur after the build is done. You can add
post build actions, that are, as the name suggests, tasks executed
after the build.

You'll find an option, <em>E-mail Notification</em> that allows you to
send an e-mail when the build is broken.

		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/screenshot_notifications_001.png">
	</a>
</p>

All you have to do is fill in the e-mail address.

		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/screenshot_notifications_002.png">
	</a>
</p>

But what if you want to send e-mails even if the build is not
broken? Or if you want to include logs, pictures, or more recipients?
There are plug-ins that gives you more options for notifications.

Not only with e-mails, there are plug-ins for sending Skype
messages, launching USB missiles, using GTalk, Jabber, IRC, among
other notification channels.

Below is an example picture of email-ext plug-in, that lets you to
add more options when sending e-mail notifications.
