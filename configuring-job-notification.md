<p>Notifications usually occur after the build is done. You can add
	post build actions, that are, as the name suggests, tasks executed
	after the build.</p>

<p>
	You'll find an option, <em>E-mail Notification</em> that allows you to
	send an e-mail when the build is broken.
</p>

		<img src="{{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/screenshot_notifications_001.png">
	</a>
</p>

<p>All you have to do is fill in the e-mail address.</p>

	</a>
</p>

<p>But what if you want to send e-mails even if the build is not
	broken? Or if you want to include logs, pictures, or more recipients?
	There are plug-ins that gives you more options for notifications.</p>

<p>Not only with e-mails, there are plug-ins for sending Skype
	messages, launching USB missiles, using GTalk, Jabber, IRC, among
	other notification channels.</p>

<p>Below is an example picture of email-ext plug-in, that lets you to
	add more options when sending e-mail notifications.</p>
