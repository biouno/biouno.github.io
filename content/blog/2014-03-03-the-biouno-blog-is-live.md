We are migrating our old website to GitHub pages. We expect that it will make typos, new docs 
and suggestions easier to get fixed, merged and released. Feel free to submit your pull requests 
or suggestions.

Right now, our focus is in completing our initial paper and releasing more plug-ins. But for that 
we also have to finish deploying the update site. As you can see, there is a lot of work to do, 
so if you have some spare time and want to join us, just [drop us a note]({{< ref "contact.html" >}}).

We hope you enjoy the new website, and have fun automating your work with Jenkins!
