In the past days two more plug-ins were released to our update center. The 
plug-ins are CLUMPP plug-in and Structure Harvester plug-in. Before that the 
first plug-ins released were the Structure and PBS plug-ins.

Structure Harvester is a Python utility with a web interface. 
It is useful to extract relevant data from Structure. CLUMPP is used 
usually after Structure and Structure Harvester. It is able to permute 
the clusters output by independent runs so that they match up as 
closely as possible.

Both plug-ins use Builders, similar to the wrappers in Galaxy, and let 
you add build steps to call the tools.
