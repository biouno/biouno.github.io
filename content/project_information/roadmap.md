    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>Item</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    	<tr>
    		<td>1</td>
    		<td>Finish our <strong>first paper</strong> (<i>work in progress</i>).</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>2</td>
    		<td>Write <strong>more plug-ins</strong> for phylogenetics and other areas (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biouno-developers">we are open for suggestions</a>).</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>3</td>
    		<td>Integrate <strong>Jenkins</strong> and <strong><a href="http://galaxyproject.org">Galaxy</a></strong> (we can use a lot of nice UI features from Galaxy).</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>4</td>
    		<td>Take a look at how <a href="http://cellprofiler.org">CellProfiler</a> handles batch processing. Jenkins can probably be used as an alternative.</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>5</td>
    		<td>Write <strong>page on how to reproduce pipelines</strong> created in Jenkins.</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>6</td>
    		<td>Add a <strong>citation standard for plug-ins</strong> (and external tools used as well). We could probably use GitHub DOI with <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>. Read more about it <a href="https://github.com/blog/1840-improving-github-for-science">here</a>.</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>7</td>
    		<td>Work on the improvement of <strong>capturing and searching analysis of metadata</strong> (Thanks for <a href="https://github.com/imoutsatsos">@imoutsatsos</a> for the suggestion)</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>8</td>
    		<td>Record <strong>videos for some of the documentation pages</strong>, like scheduling your first job or installing plugins.</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>9</td>
    		<td>Investigate if creating an alternative, <strong>pure Java, <a href="http://www.drmaa.org/">DRMAA</a> API</strong>, and a PBS binding would be doable.</td>
    	</tr>
    	<tr>
    		<td>10</td>
    		<td>Update the <strong><a href="https://github.com/biouno/pbs-plugin">PBS Plug-in</a> to work with different grid servers</strong> (probably depends on #9)</td>
    	</tr>
