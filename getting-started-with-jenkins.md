title: Getting Started with Jenkins
---
Jenkins is an Open Source leading build server. It is used by many companies 
and organizations world-wide to build software in several different programming 
languages.
	
It is written in Java, and the only requirements for getting it running are Java and 
the Jenkins archive, that you can get from [jenkins-ci.org](http://jenkins-ci.org).
	
Once you've download _jenkins.war_, you can execute Jenkins by simply 
running in a prompt <code>java -jar jenkins.war</code>. This should start Jenkins 
for you at _http://localhost:8080_.

### Other resources for learning the basics of Jenkins
	
Now you can play with your Jenkins instance, creating jobs, installing 
plug-ins and investigating other features available. Take some time to get 
used to the page names and Jenkins UI.
	
Then proceed to the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Meet+Jenkins" title="Jenkins Wiki">Jenkins Wiki</a>. There are several introductory articles and a lot of information about the plug-ins, how to extend Jenkins and 
other useful information. But should you are hungry for more information, 
there is a book with practical exercises and detailed explanation about Jenkins.
