We are happy to announce that the Jenkins plug-ins developed in the BioUno project 
will be now available online to all Jenkins instances through the plug-in manager 
interface in Jenkins.

It means that you won't need to manually install plug-ins anymore. Now you will 
be able to use Jenkins interface (or scripts) to download plug-ins. 

Follow the instructions in the page [Jenkins Update Site]({{site.baseurl}}jenkins-update-site.html) 
to add the new update center and have fun hacking your Jenkins.
