On June 18th, I attended my first ever Jenkins User Conference in Boston, USA. 

Not only I attended, but I also had the privilege to present at this meeting my work on using Jenkins as a scientific data and image management platform.

The meeting attracted more than 400 people a quite impressive number of attendees. Most of these people were of course supporting the development operations of various companies and they were clearly interested in what I call the standard Jenkins functionality and workflows.
