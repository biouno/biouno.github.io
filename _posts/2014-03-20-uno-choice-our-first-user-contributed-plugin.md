Uno-Choice has been released and is our first user contributed plug-in. This 
plug-in was proposed by Ioannis Moutsatsos, and has been described as a "proposal 
(...) for selecting one or multiple parameters. Attempting to fill the gaps left 
by current plugin options".

Version 0.1 is able to add dynamic parameters to your Jenkins jobs. You 
have the ability to create multi selects from Groovy scripts. How cool is that? 
If you miss anything in Jenkins UI for your research in bioinformatics, please 
feel free to submit your issues and we will try to help ya.
