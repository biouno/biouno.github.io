We are migrating our old web site to GitHub pages. We expect that it will make typos, new docs 
and suggestions easier to get merged and released. Feel free to submit your pull requests 
or suggestions.

Right now our focus is in completing our initial paper and releasing the plug-ins. For that, we 
also have to finish deploying the update site. That's a lot of work, so if you have some spare 
time and will to join us, just drop us a note.

We hope you enjoy the new web site, and have fun automating your work with Jenkins!
