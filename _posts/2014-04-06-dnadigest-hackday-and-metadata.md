[DNADigest](http://dnadigest.com) held a free **Hackday** this past Saturday, April 5th, in 
London. Luckily they also live transmitted the event via Internet, and it was definitely worth 
waking up at 5AM (UTC -3) to watch it!

DNADigest is a not-for-profit organization that is working on solutions for secure data sharing. 
This problem involves several fields (metadata, infrastructure, data encryption, genomics, ...) 
and is obviously a very complicated one, so props to DNADigest for working on this. 

They made sure the video for the Hackday was always working properly (big thanks Suraj!), 
but the audio wasn't so good. From what I could tell the atmosphere was really nice and made 
the whole event a very productive meeting. I hope to be near London to participate in a 
future DNADigest Hackday.

The activities were coordinated by the DNADigest team and while I couldn't listen to 
the audio very well, the [Twitter #dnahd hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dnahd&src=hash) was being 
constantly updated, and everybody was hacking together using [Hackpad](http://dnadigest.hackpad.com/).

My interest wasn't exactly on data encryption, privacy or data sharing, but yes on metadata, since this is probably one 
of the items from [BioUno roadmap](http://biouno.org) that we'll tackle next. The result was amazing. I couldn't attend it, but after the event I had a list with tools, standards and papers to read about **metadata**. 

Check the DNADigest [hackpad](http://dnadigest.hackpad.com/) and [website](http://dnadigest.com) for more, and support their [crowdfunding campaign](http://dnadigest.org/dna-digest-crowdfund/) too.
