Jenkins plug-in API is used for creating wrappers for tools like MrBayes, Structure, R and scripts 
and programs written in many different programming languages, like Perl, PHP, Ruby and Java. 
And it uses Jenkins slaves as general-purpose computing grid.

Jenkins can also be used to glue scripts and programs in your existing pipeline in Galaxy, 
Taverna, Mobyle or CloudGene. Read more about how to use Jenkins to orchestrate 
existing biology pipelines.
