title: Open Source Software for Scientific Applications
---

The ​BioUno​ open­ source project seeks to improve scientific application automation, 
performance, reproducibility, usability, and management by applying and extending software 
engineering (SE) best practices in the field of scientific research applications. 
[Deliverables from the project](/publications.html) have found a variety of applications
in life­science research (bioinformatics, genetics, drug discovery).

* We ​**explore​ and apply​** best practices in software engineering to 
support the project mission
* We **​develop extensions​** to established SE tools, frameworks and technologies that directly ​
**support​** or indirectly **​enhance​** scientific applications.  
* We **​develop APIs​** and **​integration​** points that empower scientific applications through 
the use 
* We promote **​collaboration and reuse​** through contributing to existing open source 
projects 
* We **​educate users​** through [blog](/blog/), [wiki](https://github.com/biouno),
and [presentations](/publications.html) on the application of SE best practices in
scientific applications
* We **​advocate​** with software engineers for enabling SE tools and frameworks for use 
by scientists
