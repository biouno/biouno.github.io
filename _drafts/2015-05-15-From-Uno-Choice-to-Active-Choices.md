More than a year ago I approached Bruno via a series of posts on the BioUno developer's forum and discussed my frustration with the available Jenkins user interface controls for generating advanced, dynamic user interfaces for scientific applications. I had seen partial implementations of what I thought we needed in some Jenkins plugins, but none of them was well maintained or provided in a single plugin the features I wanted. So, I asked Bruno whether it would be possible to create a new plugin with all of these features? He said 'yes' and he took on this challenge. One of Bruno's first questions was 'What should we call this new plugin?'. To credit the BioUno project contribution and my expetcation that this UI plugin would make all the related incomplete plugins obsolete, I answered 'Uno-Choice', the one choice for all your needs!

In this blog entry, I will describe a bit of the Uno-Choice plugin history until its contribution to the Jenkins project as Active Choices, a new name.
