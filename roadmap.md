The project roadmap includes in no specific order:

- Finish our first paper
- Write more plug-ins for phylogenetics and other areas
- Integrate Jenkins and [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) (we can use a lot of nice UI features from Galaxy)
- Take a look at how [CellProfiler](http://cellprofiler.org/) handles batch processing
- Write short tutorials on how to use [R Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/R+Plugin), [Image Gallery Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Image+Gallery+Plugin) and other tools/plug-ins
- Write page on how to reproduce pipelines
- Create automated release notes
- Add a citation standard for plug-ins (and external tools used as well)
- Create a cron or Jenkins (or a monitored cron) job to update the [plug-ins update center](http://biouno.org/jenkins-update-site.html)
- Work on the improvement of capturing and searching analysis of metadata (Thanks for [@imoutsatsos](https://github.com/imoutsatsos) for the suggestion)
